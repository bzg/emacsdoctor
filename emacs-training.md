employees, see [this page](http://www.2i2l.fr/spip.php?article278).

**Xmas gift!** Join a 3-days Emacs workshop organized
by [2l2l](http://www.2i2l.fr/spip.php?article278) at Paris
Montparnasse for 500€ TTC per day per participant.
See [this repository](https://github.com/bzg/emacs-training) for an
overview of the topics covered.

If you are an individual and need GNU Emacs support, please book
an [appointment online](https://rdv.bzg.fr).

If will receive your appointment request and you
can [send me an email](mailto:bzg+emacsREMOVEME@bzg.fr) to tell me
more about your needs: `.emacs.el` cleanup, list of things you'd like
to do with Emacs, etc.

I charge 80€ per hour for Emacs coaching and we can discuss the price
for regular support or custom development.
