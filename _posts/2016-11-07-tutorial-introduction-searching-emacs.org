Go to the main Info buffer with =C-h i=.  Hit =d= to make sure you are
at the top-level of the Info documentation, and go at the beginning of
the buffer with =M-<=.

Perform an incremental search for "lisp" with =C-s lisp=.

Hit =RET= to deactivate the search and the highlighting of search
matches.

Hit =C-r= to search backwards.

Now hit =C-s C-s= to search for the last search string again.

Hit =M-e= to edit the search string.  Delete "lisp" in the minibuffer
prompt, type "mode" and =RET= to reenter the search loop.

Hit =M-p=.  Your cursor will be back in the minibuffer prompt and you
can hit =M-p= and =M-n= to cycle through previous search strings, and =RET=
to search the selected string again.

Go back to the beginning of the Info buffer with =M-<=.

Hit =C-s= to start the search.

Hit =C-q C-j= to search for the newline character.

=C-q= is used to insert =C-j= and =RET= literally: if you don't use =C-q=,
typing =C-j= and =RET= in the search prompt will exit the prompt.

Hit =C-g= to abort the search.

Hit =C-s= and search for =mail=.

/Notice that both "Mail" and "mail" will be matched: the search is not
case sensitive./

Hit =C-u C-SPC= to go back to your position before your search.

While in the search loop, hit =M-c= (or =M-s c=) to toggle case
sensitivity: you will notice that now only "mail" is highlighted.

While in the search loop, hit =M-s SPC= to toggle "match spaces
loosely": when matching spaces loosely, you can search for a string
like "mail   client" (with three hard spaces) and still match the
"mail client" string.

Still in the search loop, =M-s w= will perform word-based searches.  For
example, word-based search for "mail" will not match "email".

Now try searching for =maii= instead of =mail= and then hit =DEL= to
edit the search string by deleting the last character.

Hit =C-s= and search again for "mail".

Hit =RET= on the first occurrence and go one word backward with =M-b=.

Now hit =C-s C-w= to search for the word at point (it should be "mail").

Try again with =C-s C-w C-w= to search for several words at point.

Hit =C-s C-M-y= to search for the character at point.

Hit =C-M-y C-M-y= to add the next two characters to the search string.

Hit =C-M-w= to remove the last character from the search string.

Exit the search with =C-g=.

Info buffers are read-only by default: hit =M-d= on a word to copy it.
In normal buffers, you would use =C-M-SPC= to mark the "sexp" under
cursor (here, the "sexp" is simply a word), then =M-w= to copy it
(i.e. to "add it to the kill-ring).

Now hit =C-s= again, then =C-y= to paste (i.e. "yank") the text in the
search area.

Hit =C-s C-M-i=.  This will displays a new window with a list of
possible completions for the current search string.

[[file:img/2016-11-07-emacs-search-completion.png]]

Hit =M-<= and =C-s= to search for "mail".

Now hit =M-s o= to list lines where "mail" occurs.

[[file:img/2016-11-07-emacs-search-occur.png]]

Hit =C-s= and =M-r= (or =M-s r=) to switch to regular expression search.

Go to an org-mode buffer.  Hit =M-TAB= to cycle through visibility
status and stop when in the =OVERVIEW= mode (everything is folded).

Search for hidden text: the matched string is automatically unfolded
when the cursor moves to it.

Exit the search.

Still in this org-mode buffer, hit =M-TAB= to fold the subtrees and hit
=C-s M-s i= to search for visible text only.  Invisible text won't be
matched.

In any buffer, hit =C-s C-h b= to browse the search options.

*Things I wish I knew sooner:*

- =C-s M-e= to edit the search string
- =C-s M-w= to search for word at point
- =C-s M-r= to toggle search by regular expressions
- =C-s M-s o= to run =occur= on the current search string
- =C-s C-M-i= to complete the current search string
- =C-s a-test-string M-x= to replace the matched string in the buffer

And you, what are your Emacs search "ahah!" moment?
